This Python script fetches current weather data for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## How It Works
- The script makes an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the specified city.
- It then processes the JSON response to extract relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- The data is displayed in the terminal/console.

## Usage
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Replace the API_KEY variable with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
- Run the script, and it will display the current weather for the specified city.

## Dependencies
- requests library
- datetime module
